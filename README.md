# AD320-IA2-winslow

This repository contains an html page that contains a form and a php script that processes the form data and displays back to the user. 
In the html form there are name, email address, phone number, and state of residence fields for the user to enter. Name and email are required and form will not submit without those entries. Phone number and state are optional. 

The php script will return the results of the users entry data using a GET method. If phone number and state are blank, nothing will print out.
